<h1>Customisation</h1>

## Jekyll configuration

Jekyll configuration is stored at the root of the site repository in a YAML file called `_config.yml`. General documentation about Jekyll configuration can be found [here](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/configuration/).

In addition to general Jekyll configurations, Open SDG needs some specific configurations. For more information on these, please see the [configuration page](https://open-sdg.readthedocs.io/en/latest/configuration/).

## Optional features

As with any Jekyll theme, Open SDG can be easily customised. The platform comes with some out-of-the-box optional features that can serve as examples of possible customisations.

### Optional feature: Goal page layouts

Open SDG includes two alternative [layouts](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/step-by-step/04-layouts/) for the 17 goal pages:

1. [`goal`](https://github.com/open-sdg/open-sdg/blob/master/_layouts/goal.html) - Indicators are displayed in a responsive grid
1. [`goal-by-target`](https://github.com/open-sdg/open-sdg/blob/master/_layouts/goal-by-target.html) - Targets on the left, and indicators on the right

If you are using the `create_goals` setting, you can change the layout as described [here](https://open-sdg.readthedocs.io/en/latest/configuration/#create_goals).

Otherwise you can set the layout by adjusting the [front matter](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/front-matter/) of the goal file. For example, to use the goal-by-target layout, you would need this in the goal's front matter:

`layout: goal-by-target`

## Working with (remote) Jekyll themes

This project (the repository you are reading currently) functions as a [Jekyll theme](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/themes/), which can most easily be used with the help of the [Remote Theme plugin](https://github.com/benbalter/jekyll-remote-theme). As with any Jekyll theme (and as can be seen in the [folder structure of this project](https://github.com/open-sdg/open-sdg)) the entirety of the theme is contained in these 3 folders:

1. _includes
1. _layouts
1. assets

Any file in these folders can be "overridden" simply by placing the same file in your site repository. When Jekyll compiles the platform, it will give precedence to files in your site repository, over the corresponding file in this remote theme.

In this way, any of the files in these folders can be customised to your platform's needs, without requiring any changes to the files in this theme.

### Overriding Javascript

As you can see, the [main Javascript file](https://github.com/open-sdg/open-sdg/blob/master/assets/js/sdg.js) is simply a series of include statements, being aggregated into one file. Jekyll looks for "includes" in the `_includes` folder, and indeed you can see these individual Javascript files [in there](https://github.com/open-sdg/open-sdg/tree/master/_includes/assets/js). This gives you the ability to override any of these Javascript files individually.

The main takeaway here is that these indivdual Javascript files are in `_includes` rather than `assets`, as you might normally expect.

## Adding custom CSS

You may have noticed in the Jekyll configuration section above the `custom_css` option. Using this, you can easily add custom CSS files, to be loaded onto the page after the "default" CSS of this platform.

## Working with Jekyll templates

Jekyll provides a `page` variable for use in any of files in `_layouts` and `_includes` (referred to here as "templates"). This `page` variable contains helpful contextual information about the current page being rendered. Open SDG adds additional information for your use.

### Variables available on all pages

The following variables can be used on any page:

* `page.goals`

    An array of all the SDG Goals available. Each item in the array contains information about the goal. See "Goal objects" below.

    Usage example - printing the names of each goal:

    ```
    {% for goal in page.goals %}
      {{ goal.name }}
    {% endfor %}
    ```

* `page.targets`

    An array of all the SDG Targets available. Each item in the array contains information about the target. See "Target objects" below.

    Usage example - printing the names of each target:

    ```
    {% for target in page.targets %}
    {{ target.name }}
    {% endfor %}
    ```

* `page.indicators`

    An array of all the SDG Indicators available. Each item in the array contains information about the indicator. See "Indicator objects" below.

    Usage example - printing the names of each indicator:

    ```
    {% for indicator in page.indicators %}
    {{ indicator.name }}
    {% endfor %}
    ```

* `page.baseurl`

    This should be used instead of `site.baseurl`, because it includes necessary subfolders according to the language of the current page.

    Usage example - printing a link to another page:

    ```
    <a href="{{ page.baseurl }}/my-page/">My page</a>
    ```

* `page.language`

    The language code for the current page.

    Usage example - printing the current language code:

    ```
    The current language code is {{ page.language }}.
    ```

* `page.language_public`

    The "public" language code for the current page. This may be different from `page.language` in special cases where you prefer a language code that is different from the standard language code for your language. Most sites will not use this.

    Usage example - printing the current public language code:

    ```
    The current language code is {{ page.language }}, but the "public" language code is {{ page.language_public }}.
    ```

* `page.t`

    The translations for the current language. More detail on this is available [here](https://open-sdg.readthedocs.io/en/latest/configuration/).

    Usage example - printing the translation of the word "Goal" (which is available with the key "goal" in the "general" group:

    ```
    {{ page.t.general.goal }}
    ```

* `page.url_by_language`

    This contains URLs to the current page, but in each language. This is useful if you'd like to link to the same page but in another language.

    Usage example - printing a link to the Spanish version of the current page:

    ```
    <a href="{{ page.url_by_language.es }}">Spanish version</a>
    ```

### Variables available on Goal pages only

The following variables can be used on goal pages only:

* `page.goal`

    Information about the current goal. See "Goal objects" below.

    Usage example - printing the name of the current goal:

    ```
    {{ page.goal.name }}
    ```

### Variables available on Indicator pages only

The following variables can be used on indicator pages only:

* `page.goal`

    Information about the current goal. See "Goal objects" below.

    Usage example - printing the name of the current goal:

    ```
    {{ page.goal.name }}
    ```

* `page.target`

    Information about the current target. See "Target objects" below.

    Usage example - printing the name of the current target:

    ```
    {{ page.target.name }}
    ```

* `page.indicator`

    Information about the current indicator. See "Indicator objects" below.

    Usage example - printing the name of the current indicator:

    ```
    {{ page.indicator.name }}
    ```
