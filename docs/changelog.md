Breaking changes:

* The reporting status page has been refactored, and the following changes will be needed:
    * In the data repository, make sure the order of the `reporting_status` options in your `_prose.yml` file matches the order you would like them to appear on the page. Example [here](https://github.com/open-sdg/open-sdg-data-starter/commit/3f22d5529c1b3084c3b06665a5e2920cff0aff17).
    * In the data repository, make sure you are using at least version 0.3.0 of SDG Build. Example [here](https://github.com/open-sdg/open-sdg-data-starter/commit/55d91b5952b3cd6ca6d1ddc4601354e8acc4c22b).
    * In the site repository, make sure you are pulling in this new data in the `jekyll_get_json` section. Example [here](https://github.com/open-sdg/open-sdg-site-starter/commit/7986def8a1b82f8754f22a69154560ac33374dd3).
* All goal pages will need updated permalinks. Example [here](https://github.com/open-sdg/open-sdg-site-starter/commit/f421fa542687dfba2fcf93c209a8bdf9d4498c0a).
* You may also want to create redirects from the old permalinks. Example [here](https://github.com/GSA/sdg-indicators-usa/commit/648c1a9ae037ea22ed65bcf4158f7d1612934d2b) and [here](https://github.com/brockfanning/sdg-indicators/commit/e0093955cdafef93e31847cba61837881ada3e04).
