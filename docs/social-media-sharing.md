<h1>Sharing pages via social media</h1>

## Sticky share buttons
The sticky share buttons allow users to share a page of the data website via social media (Facebook and Twitter) and via email as shown [here](https://platform.sharethis.com/get-sticky-share-buttons?utm_source=googleadwords&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=follow_buttons_linkedin&gclid=Cj0KCQjw1MXpBRDjARIsAHtdN-0-DX6oc9RzUh_wCU1_fvAB4rnA_adGse0PgocDQTPc3_rzLkucPocaAn1PEALw_wcB).


## Configuring sticky share buttons
To set up the sticky share buttons on your country's data website, the following line of code needs to be uncommented in the config.yml file:</br>
`#sharethis_property: '5d279253faeee40012f195e1'`<br>
e.g. `sharethis_property: '5d279253faeee40012f195e1'`

You can also add your own property by [signing up to ShareThis](https://platform.sharethis.com/sign-up). Adding your own property means that you will be able to configure the buttons to how you want them e.g. add more buttons for different social media platforms.
